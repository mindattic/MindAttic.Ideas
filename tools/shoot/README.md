# ma-shoot — photograph every MindAttic project

Captures a screenshot of each project for its Ideas brochure page, then those images go into
MindAttic.Media and are referenced from a page as `<Component.MediaImage uid="…" />`.

```pwsh
cd tools/shoot
npm install
node shoot.mjs --list          # what would run
node shoot.mjs                 # everything enabled
node shoot.mjs --only hyperspace
```

Output lands in `out/` (gitignored) with an `index.json` describing the run. To ingest:

```pwsh
dotnet run --project src/MindAttic.Ideas.Blazor -- --upload-media <abs paths…> --folder screenshots
```

## Why a manifest instead of detection

A survey of the 34 repos found static sites, Vite apps, ASP.NET hosts, WPF apps, console tools and
pure libraries — and heuristics get it wrong in ways worse than useless. A stray `index.html` in a
docs folder outranks the real application; Prose's project scan turns up eight `.csproj` files,
several inside `.claude/worktrees` and not source at all. Worse, one repo often has **several**
visual surfaces (Prose has a CLI *and* an observer UI), so "the" screenshot for a repo is not even a
well-formed idea.

So every shot is declared in [`shots.json`](shots.json): reviewable, re-runnable, and corrected by
editing one entry rather than fighting a guess.

## Drivers

| Driver | For | How |
|---|---|---|
| `web-static` | a repo with a root `index.htm(l)` | serves the directory over http, then shoots it |
| `web-cmd` | a build step or a dev server | runs `build` then serves `serveDir`, or runs `run` and waits for `readyUrl` |
| `console` | a CLI | runs the command, captures stdout, composes it as a terminal card |

**Why http and not `file://`** — modules, `fetch()`, workers and textures all trip CORS or an opaque
origin under `file://`, so a 3D gallery that works when double-clicked renders an empty canvas under
automation. Serving over http keeps the capture honest.

**Why the console driver renders rather than screenshots a window** — a real console screenshot needs
the window visible, sized, unobscured and on a machine with a desktop session, none of which holds on
a build agent, and it differs every run. Capturing stdout and composing it is deterministic, works
headless, keeps ANSI colour, and looks better than OS console chrome.

## Shot options

`viewport` `[w,h]` · `scale` (device pixel ratio, default 2) · `settleMs` (a 3D scene needs *frames*,
not a load event — `networkidle` fires long before the first render) · `waitFor` (selectors) ·
`actions` (`click` / `press` / `evaluate` / `waitMs`, for dismissing a splash or entering a gallery) ·
`clip` (screenshot one element) · `enabled: false` to park a shot.

## Generating the brochure pages

`brochures.py` writes a `<Component.ProjectBrochure>` body for every `projects/*` page.

**The tagline is lifted from each project's own README**, never invented — the READMEs were seeded
from GitHub, so they are the project's own words and stay true when the repo changes. What the README
cannot supply is left off rather than guessed. GitHub's empty-repo stub ("This repository does not
have a README yet") is filtered out: quoting it under the title reads as if it meant something.

A project with no screenshot gets [`assets/no-screenshot.svg`](assets/no-screenshot.svg) rather than
an empty frame, so every page has the same shape and the gaps are visible instead of invisible.

It needs two inputs beside it:

```pwsh
# 1. the pages + their seeded READMEs
sqlcmd -S "(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB" -d MindAtticIdeas -y 0 -o pages.json -Q `
  "SET NOCOUNT ON; SELECT p.Slug, p.Title, ISNULL(m.MetadataJson,'') AS Meta FROM Pages p
   LEFT JOIN ComponentMetadata m ON m.PageUid = p.Uid AND m.ComponentKey = 'frommd'
   WHERE p.Slug LIKE 'projects/%' AND p.IsDeleted = 0 ORDER BY p.Slug FOR JSON PATH;"
# sqlcmd chunks FOR JSON at 2033 chars — strip the physical newlines to reassemble it.

# 2. the placeholder's media uid, one line
dotnet run --project src/MindAttic.Ideas.Blazor -- --upload-media tools/shoot/assets/no-screenshot.svg --folder screenshots

python brochures.py                      # -> brochures-all.sql
sqlcmd -S "(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB" -d MindAtticIdeas -f 65001 -i brochures-all.sql
```

**`-f 65001` is not optional.** sqlcmd reads a UTF-8 script as ANSI otherwise, and every em-dash in
the page copy silently becomes mojibake.

As screenshots land, add them to the `SHOTS` map and re-run — the pages regenerate in place.
