/// MindAttic.Ideas.Plugin.SacredGeometry.V1 — the 1024-shape SacredGeometry catalog + renderer as a
/// self-contained Plugin (the .idea target of the canonical UiUx <c>Components/SacredGeometry</c>
/// source). A code-only capability activator: it emits the renderer (<c>window.SacredGeometry</c>) plus
/// a tiny auto-init driver, both bundled in this package's wwwroot/ and served under
/// <c>/_ideas/Plugin/sacredgeometry/1/</c>. Dropping it on a page makes every
/// <c>&lt;canvas data-sacred-shape="N"&gt;</c> animate shape N live (IntersectionObserver-gated,
/// MutationObserver-aware) — no per-page JS. The driver loads AFTER the renderer.
/// Instance settings (MAI-A45) reach the driver through <c>data-ma-settings="plugin.sacredgeometry"</c>
/// and are page-wide defaults; a canvas's own data-sacred-spin / data-sacred-bg still win.
