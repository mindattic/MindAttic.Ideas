/// MAI-A44: physically eliminates conflicting older CSS within a single author's own CSS text, rather
/// than leaving it for the browser's cascade to sort out. This is deliberately scoped to ONE CSS text at
/// a time -- it never reads or rewrites Theme/Component/Global CSS (those are either external files this
/// app doesn't own, or a host-wide setting shared by every page, so mutating them as a side effect of
/// saving one page would corrupt every other page's rendering). Precedence ACROSS tiers remains entirely
/// the job of cascade layers (MAI-A43/A44, CmsHead.razor); this class only cleans up a single tier's own
/// accumulated, possibly self-contradicting declarations.
///
/// The browser's cascade already resolves two separate "same selector" rule blocks correctly on its own
/// (same specificity/origin -> source order decides, per longhand property) -- so this isn't fixing a
/// rendering bug. Its value is readability/maintainability: a human editing the file sees ONE
/// authoritative block per selector with dead, superseded declarations physically removed, instead of
/// having to mentally simulate the cascade across scattered duplicate blocks.
///
/// Because that's the goal, this deliberately does a MINIMAL-DIFF rewrite: only the specific rule blocks
/// that are genuinely part of a same-selector duplicate group are touched. A hand-rolled, comment/string
/// -aware top-level tokenizer (<see cref="Segment"/>) finds those blocks by raw text span; everything
/// else -- comments, @media/@font-face/@keyframes blocks, single-occurrence rules, whitespace -- passes
/// through byte-for-byte untouched. (An earlier version ran the WHOLE text through AngleSharp.Css's
/// parse+reserialize round-trip; that's simpler but destroys every comment -- AngleSharp's CSSOM has no
/// concept of a comment at all -- and reformats every value it touches, e.g. "red" -> "rgba(255,0,0,1)",
/// even for rules with nothing to merge. Confirmed empirically against real library CSS files, several
/// of which have dozens of section comments; that trade-off was rejected.)
///
/// AngleSharp.Css is still used, narrowly, to compute the actual merged property set for a duplicate
/// group: its parser already expands every shorthand property into its true spec-defined longhand form
/// (margin/padding -> 4-way; border -> 12-way per-side width/style/color; border-radius -> 4 corners;
/// background -> its per-layer longhands; font, transition, animation, etc. likewise) -- confirmed
/// empirically; box-shadow/text-shadow are the one family it does NOT expand (no real longhand exists),
/// so they stay a single atomic value, matching the deliberate product decision never to invent a
/// non-standard decomposition for them.
