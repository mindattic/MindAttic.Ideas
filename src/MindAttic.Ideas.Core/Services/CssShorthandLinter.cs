/// declaration (e.g. "margin: 10px") still overwrites all of its longhand sub-properties in source
/// order, same as always. An author who writes both a shorthand and one (but not all) of its longhand
/// siblings anywhere in PageCss most likely meant a single-side override that the shorthand will
/// silently clobber. This is a pure text heuristic, not a CSS parser: it is whole-document scoped (not
/// selector-block scoped) and blind to Theme/Global CSS, so it can flag pairs that don't actually target
/// the same element, and can't see cross-tier collisions -- acceptable for an advisory hint.
///
/// <see cref="CssConflictMerger"/> (MAI-A44) now automatically expands and collapses same-selector
/// shorthand/longhand conflicts within Untrusted PageCss at save time, using AngleSharp.Css's real
/// parser rather than this regex heuristic. This linter's remaining job is everything the merger
/// doesn't cover: Author-trusted PageCss (the merger never touches it -- MAI-LAW-5 verbatim guarantee),
/// and non-exact-selector conflicts the merger deliberately leaves alone.
